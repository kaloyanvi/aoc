## Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for AoC problems.

Make sure [Dev](https://github.com/MasonData/dev) is installed before continuing.

Setup env in repo's root directory:

```
dev up
```

You can automatically start on a new problem by running the command:

```
make create YEAR=23 DAY=2
```

This will:

- create a directory for the provided day
- create two files; `solution.ts` and `input.txt`
- open the files in VS code
- start the solution script in watch mode waiting for changes
